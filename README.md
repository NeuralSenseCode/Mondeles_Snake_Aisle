# Mondeles Snake Aisle

Initial scaffold for the Mondeles Snake Aisle project.

## Structure
- `data/` raw or received datasets (gitignored by default except a placeholder)
- `notebooks/` exploratory Jupyter notebooks
- `analysis/` scripts or refined notebooks for reporting
- `results/` generated outputs (figures, tables, exports)
- `src/` Python source modules (processing, models, utilities)

## Environment
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Next Steps
1. Place sample data into `data/` (avoid committing confidential/raw PII).
2. Create an initial data exploration notebook in `notebooks/`.
3. Add processing utilities into `src/`.
4. Define analysis pipeline scripts inside `analysis/`.
