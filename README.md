# Mondeles Snake Aisle

This project is run using Neurons. The main objectives are two fold:

Objective 1:  Use the AI Enabled Predictive Eye-tracking solution to build a case for not only optimising confectionary.\
Objective 2: Demonstrate that household goods should be deprioritised at snake aisle

We used Neurons, an eye-tracking based AI and ML predictive tool to in conjuction with images of both the Confectionary and Household goods images

## Structure
- `data/` raw or received datasets (gitignored by default except a placeholder)
- `notebooks/` exploratory Jupyter notebooks
- `results/` generated outputs (figures, tables, exports)
- `src/` Python source modules (processing, models, utilities)

## Environment
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Next Steps
1. Place sample data into `data/` (avoid committing confidential/raw PII).
2. Create an initial data exploration notebook in `notebooks/`.
3. Add processing utilities into `src/`.
4. Define analysis pipeline scripts inside `analysis/`.
